# Social Media Cannibal

This project is a simple web application that allows users to generate a shareable image with a custom message about the value of their data to social media platforms like Instagram.

## How it Works

The application uses JavaScript to estimate the value of a user's data based on the following factors:

*   **Geolocation:** The user's country, as determined by their browser's geolocation API.
*   **Device Model:** The user's device model, as determined by their browser's user agent string.
*   **Age and Gender:** The user's age and gender, as provided by the user.
*   **Usage Behavior:** How the user interacts with the platform, as provided by the user.

The application then generates an image with a custom message that includes the estimated value of the user's data. The user can then download the image or take a screenshot to share on social media.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Fill in the form with your data.
3.  Click the "Generate Image" button.
4.  The generated image will be displayed on the page.
5.  You can then download the image or take a screenshot to share on social media.
